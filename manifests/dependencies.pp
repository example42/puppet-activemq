# Class: activemq::dependencies
#
# This class includes resources provided by other Example42 modules
# It's automatically included by default in order to provide
# a correct module setup, but you might want to provide the same
# resources in a custom way, using other modules.
# If so set install_dependencies to false and be sure that what
# is placed here is managed by your modules/manifests.
#
# == Usage
#
# This class is not intended to be used directly.
#
class activemq::dependencies {

  # Provide the PuppetLabs yum repo for seamless activemq setup

    'centos','redhat','scientific': {
